    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            My name is Steven Nevells and I was born in Baltimore, Maryland. I graduated high school in Pennsylvania,
             then promptly moved to San Diego, California. There I pursued junior college while working full time
             in the service industry. After transferring and working in restaurants in Hawaii and Colorado, I began my
             transition into restaurant management. After managing, I began my pursuit of a career in web developmenmt.
             I now attend a bootcamp provided by U of A in full stack web development.
